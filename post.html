          Cicero composed De finibus bonorum et malorum — On the Ends of Goods and Evils —in the spring and summer of 45 BC, 
          exiled from political life at Rome and mere months after the death of his beloved daughter, Tullia. In it,
          he set out with force, elegance, and philosophical nuance the central doctrines of Hellenistic ethics, a summation of some three hundred years of ethical debate and argument among the main philosophical schools.
          He wrote as a life-long student of Greek philosophy, but also as an independent and supremely educated thinker with a considered commitment to the methods of the skeptical Academy.
          This collection of nine essays—papers delivered at the twelfth Symposium Hellenisticum—approaches De finibus in that light, treating it as a serious work of philosophy and paying attention to the complex dialectical framework in which Cicero expounds and criticizes the position of each school.
          The essays are nicely balanced in their focus, roughly divided between treatments of Epicureanism and Stoicism. Two of the essays—those of Margaret Graver and Brad Inwood—are rooted in De finibus but nonetheless deal with themes central to much of Cicero’s philosophical work.

        <p>
          The initial, framing essay by Charles Brittain offers a fundamental—even radical—reassessment of Cicero’s own Academic skepticism,
          challenging the usual reading according to which Cicero, following Philo of Larissa, rejects the possibility of certain knowledge but nonetheless regards some views as more plausible than others.
          Against this understanding of Cicero as a “mitigated” skeptic, Brittain argues that De finibus as a whole treats no single position as more plausible or persuasive than any other, thereby dramatizing a more radical skepticism Cicero inherits through Carneades’ 
          disciple Clitomachus: a principled, “intractable doubt” requiring the wholesale suspension of assent. Brittain bases this reading on parallels with the Academica —which sets rival epistemological accounts in a similar equipollent frame—and also on a series of close observations about the structure of De finibus itself. 
          Thus Brittain observes, notably, that the dialogue’s dramatic settings are presented in reverse chronological order, complicating the standard assumption that Cicero’s own considered view emerges in the Antiochean perspective of Books 4 and 5.
          This intricate paper is full of insights despite its controversial thesis.

          The three essays that follow deal with the presentation and critique of Epicureanism in De finibus 1 and 2. 
          James Warren offers a lengthy exposition of the central arguments about Epicurean pleasure, including especially Cicero’s allegation that the Epicureans offer no unitary account of pleasure and in fact group under the heading of ‘pleasure’ diverse phenomena that are too dissimilar to share the name.
          Pierre-Marie Morel’s essay considers whether the cardinal virtues discussed by Torquatus but not mentioned in other Epicurean sources have an authentic place in orthodox Epicureanism.
          Morel’s answer is that they do not, but that Cicero has Torquatus discuss the traditional virtues in order to highlight the instrumental status Epicureanism must assign to them.
          Cicero thereby casts the Epicurean position as fundamentally opposed to the conception of virtue—as praiseworthy for its own sake—that is essential to both the Stoic and Antiochean positions. Torquatus’ focus on the cardinal
        </p>
        <h3>Section 1.1</h3>
        <p>
          virtues in Book 1 contributes in this way to the “global strategy” of De finibus, providing a counterpoint to the ethical expositions to come (94). 
          The third essay, by Dorothea Frede, takes up a related criticism of Epicurean friendship: friends should be esteemed for their own sake, 
          but Epicurean theory seems able to accommodate friendship only as an instrumental means to the end of pleasure.
          Frede discusses three Epicurean replies to this criticism as they are reported by Torquatus (1.66-70), each intended to show that friends may consistently be valued propter se. Her discussion elaborates and clarifies the structure of each reply,
          but it serves mainly to highlight the basic equivocation on which all three rejoinders appear to rest: 
          a conflation of what is desired as an indispensable means with what is desired for its own sake. There is little in De finibus, or in Frede’s essay,
          to indicate whether the Epicurean arguments on which Cicero drew could have avoided this fatal equivocation. On the whole, the impression given by Cicero’s report, and by Frede’s discussion, is that they could not.
